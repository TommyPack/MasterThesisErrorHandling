{\Large \textbf{ Statutory Declaration}}

\vspace{1cm}

I hereby declare that
%
\begin{itemize}
\item 	I have independently written the presented Master thesis by myself.
\item	I have prepared this Master thesis without outside help and without using any sources or aids other than those cited by me; moreover, I have identified as such any passages taken verbatim or in terms of content from the sources used.
\item	in addition, I have fully indicated the use of generative AI models (e.g. ChatGPT) by specifying the product name and the reference source (e.g. URL).
\item   I have not used any other unauthorized aids and have consistently worked independently and when using generative AI models, I realize that I am responsible how the content will be used and to what extent.
\item   I have not yet submitted this Master thesis in the same or similar form to any (other) educational institution as an examination performance or (scientific) thesis.
\item   I am aware that any violation ("use of unauthorized aids") violates academic integrity and may result in (academic-related) legal consequences.
\item	one copy of the Master Thesis is deposited and made available in the CUAS
	library (\textsection 8 Austrian Copyright Law [UrhG]).
\end{itemize} 
%
I fully understand that I am responsible myself for the application for a patent,
trademark or ornamental design and that I have to prosecute any resultant
claims by myself.
